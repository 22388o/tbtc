In this section we describe improvements which can be made in the TBTC protocol
in order to its capital efficiency and security.

== Using TBTC instead of ETH for Signers' bonds

As described previously in the document, we require each 1 BTC deposit to be
backed by 1.5 BTCETH ("1.5 BTC worth of ETH") before 1 tBTC is minted on
Ethereum. The overcollateralization is done in order to prevent the system from
being undercollateralized when large ETH price fluctuations occur. This means
that  for each minted `1 tBTC` a total lockup of `2.5 BTC` value is required
(2.5x of the value). 

We can reduce this capital cost by allowing `1 BTCTBTC` ("1 BTC worth of TBTC"),
to be used as collateral to mint `1 tBTC`. We believe this is a
reasonable design to choice, since due to the supply peg between BTC and TBTC, there
will always be less TBTC than BTC and they should trade at parity. 
Initially, the TBTC supply will be bootstrapped by using ETH as bonds, 
and the system will get more capital efficient as TBTC is used to back further
TBTC minting. 

Example:

Consider 10 BTC under custody, 10 TBTC supply, and 9.95 TBTC in circulation (due to fees), 
backed by 15 BTCETH. By using 9 TBTC as collateral, 9 more TBTC can be minted,
resulting in a total supply of 19 TBTC, backed by 9 TBTC and 15 BTCETH on
Ethereum. This results in 9.95 TBTC being liquid, while 10.05 is used in bonds. 
If 9 TBTC more get created in the same way, only 9.9 TBTC would be liquid, 
but the TBTC supply will be 28. Following this example, the
capital efficiency (tBTC supply over illiquid collateral) of the mechanism can
approach 100% asymptotically, which is a significant improvement over the 66%
capital efficiency when using only ETH.

This mechanism effectively improves capital efficiency by
reducing TBTC liquidity. This incentive loop
can be maintained with proper fee generation to signers. We expect that signers
who want exposure in ETH will still use ETH as collateral, which will also
increase TBTC's liquidity. The following chart indicates how TBTC liquid supply
and capital efficiency behave in the previous example as the TBTC supply
approaches 100. Note how when we additionally back a deposit with ETH, TBTC
liquidity improves at the expense of capital efficiency.

In the next section, we explore potential approaches towards 
maximizing the fee revenue of signers by leveraging decentralized finance
lending  and market making protocols.
