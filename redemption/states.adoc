== Withdrawal Flow

*TODO*: Link flow state names and transition names from elsewhere in
documentation to here

This is the process to redeem a deposit. Once started, redemption cannot be
cancelled, except by proving signer fraud. Cancellation is impossible because
as soon as redemption is requested the signers are permitted to sign, and a
signature (even one neither chain knows about) can't be revoked.

Ergo, cancellation of this process could result in BTC moved from the signers'
address, and an Active Deposit with TBTC outstanding. This would result in a
supply peg-break.

The requestor notifies the `Deposit` of the bitcoin tx information (fee and
recipient pkh) they are requesting, along with enough TBTC to cover the
outstanding TBTC from the `Deposit` (counting any existing equity).
