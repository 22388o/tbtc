# tBTC

tBTC is a trustlessly Bitcoin-backed ERC-20 token.

The goal of the project is to provide a stronger 2-way peg than federated
sidechains like [Liquid](https://blockstream.com/liquid/), expanding use cases
possible via today's Bitcoin network, while bringing superior money to other
chains.

This is the primary repo of the project, containing the
[project documentation](index.adoc) and majority of the [on-chain code](src/).

## Building

[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/keep-network/tbtc.svg?style=svg&circle-token=ec728f5ca814b6cb2db5ffeb7258151b752a207e)](https://circleci.com/gh/keep-network/tbtc)

The docs and Solidity are built [via CircleCI](.circleci/).

## Documentation

The documentation includes a project overview and rationale, as well as the
on-chain specification. Docs should always be updated before or in tandem with
code.
