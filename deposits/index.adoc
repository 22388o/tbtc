== Overview

TBTC provides a mechanism for creating a token, TBTC, that is 1-to-1 backed by
Bitcoin. Parties interested in minting TBTC <<Deposit Request,request>> that the
TBTC system provide them with a Bitcoin wallet address. The system selects a set
of _signers_, which are tasked with generating a private/public keypair and
furnishing it to the system. The interested party then becomes a _depositor_ by
sending Bitcoin to the wallet (the amount of required Bitcoin is discussed
separately in the section on <<Lots,lots>>). The Bitcoin that is sent to the
wallet is in two parts: one is eligible for 1-to-1 minting into TBTC, while the
other is reserved as incentive for the wallet signers.

Each of these steps is discussed in detail below.
