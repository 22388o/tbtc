= Relay maintainer

== Prerequisites
- https://golang.org/[Go] (at least 1.15.7)

== Build

Build the binary using:
```
go build
```
An executable named `relay` will be created.

== Run

To run the application invoke:
```
./relay start
```
Usually, you'll want to set the log level and pass the operator key file
password while running the `start` command. To do so, you can use `LOG_LEVEL`
and `OPERATOR_KEY_FILE_PASSWORD` environment variables. For additional
info, please refer those help commands:
```
./relay --help
./relay start --help
```
