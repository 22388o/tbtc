== Overview

== Prior Work

* Liquid - centralized, fiat, provable, redeemable
* WBTC - centralized, fiat, provable, redeemable
* Maker - decentralized, synthetic (irredeemable)

downsides of a "fiat" BTC peg
* note this includes all current sidechain implementations AFAIK

downsides of a synthetic BTC
* need more diverse / resilient collateral, and that's difficult to find on-chain
* upsides - there might be some value to having an asset pegged to BTC that doesn't

== Desired Properties

Maintains "hard money" status
- censorship and seizure resistant
- minting only possible with a BTC deposit
- no additional leverage or exposure on the pegged asset (avoid artificially inflating the supply)

Redeemable

== Developing Intuition: A simple single-signer protocol

=== The downsides of a single signer

== System Architecture: Designing a robust multi-wallet multi-signer protocol
